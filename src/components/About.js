          Hi, I'm Cooroot, a music producer based in Kyrgyzstan. I produce
          electronic music in different genres like dubstep, trap, future bass,
          future garage and sometimes lo-fi.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been making music since February 2016 and been producing mostly
          dubstep. But these days you might hear some more of the other genres.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides making electronic music I also play guitar, do graphic design
          and coding. Mostly, I make track covers and edit music videos myself.
          This website is also written by me.
